### Why is Java so popular?

---

A few important reasons:
- Java is very backwards compatible. This means when a new version is released, in all likelihood, your existing code will just work. That's a huge deal to large organisations that have multiple projects and millions of lines of code.
- Java standardizes a lot like how things must be named, and even makes recommendations on code formatting. This means that all java code looks very similar, which makes the code easy to read. So when you swap people on projects, the learning curve isn't steep.
- Java is very verbose. This can be a pain in the ass when coding, but ByteArrayInputStream leaves little to the imagination. When you need to maintain code, that verbosity really helps.
- Java developer tools are excellent. They're frigging spectacular compared to most other languages.
- Java has an enormous ecosystem that had evolved over many years. When starting a project, it's great knowing that most of your grunt work can be handled easily. See the apache software Foundation for tons of high quality tools.
